# Kidney_stone_detection
This project concludes that the integration of the SE block within the C3 block of YOLOv5m significantly enhances the performance of the model in detecting kidney stones from CT images. The proposed model achieves higher precision and recall with only a slight increase in computational complexity, making it a superior choice for medical imaging applications. This research highlights the potential of the proposed model to improve the accuracy and efficiency of kidney stone detection, which could have significant implications for real-time medical diagnosis.
